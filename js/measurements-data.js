            { id: "3.1.1a", title: "Fundamental (base) units", prompt: "Can you recall and state the 7 fundamental SI units and their corresponding quantities (mass - kg, length - m, time - s, current - A, temperature - K, amount of substance - mol)? Can you distinguish them from derived units?" },
            { id: "3.1.1b", title: "SI prefixes and standard form", prompt: "Are you confident in using and converting between SI prefixes, from tera (T) to femto (f)? Can you express quantities in standard form (e.g., A × 10ⁿ) and convert between different units, such as Joules (J) and electronvolts (eV)?" },
            { id: "3.1.2a", title: "Random and systematic errors", prompt: "Can you define and differentiate between random errors (unpredictable variations) and systematic errors (consistent offsets)? Can you suggest practical methods to reduce the impact of each type in an experiment?" },
            { id: "3.1.2b", title: "Precision, accuracy, resolution", prompt: "Can you clearly explain the distinction between precision (consistency of results), accuracy (closeness to the true value), and resolution (the smallest change a measuring instrument can detect)?" },
            { id: "3.1.2c", title: "Absolute and percentage uncertainties", prompt: "Can you calculate absolute, fractional, and percentage uncertainties from a set of repeated measurements? For example, can you find the uncertainty in a mean value?" },
            { id: "3.1.2d", title: "Combining uncertainties", prompt: "Do you know the rules for combining uncertainties? Can you correctly calculate the uncertainty in a final result when quantities are added, subtracted, multiplied, divided, or raised to a power?" },
            { id: "3.1.2e", title: "Error bars and graph analysis", prompt: "Can you plot error bars on a graph to represent uncertainty? Can you determine the uncertainty in the gradient and y-intercept of a line of best fit by drawing lines of maximum and minimum slope?" },
            { id: "3.1.3a", title: "Orders of magnitude", prompt: "Can you estimate physical quantities (like the mass of a car or the height of a building) to the nearest power of 10 (order of magnitude)?" },
            { id: "3.1.3b", title: "Estimation calculations", prompt: "Can you use your estimations of physical quantities to perform further calculations and derive other estimates, checking the reasonableness of your results?" }
